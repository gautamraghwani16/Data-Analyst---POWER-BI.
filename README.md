# Data-Analyst---POWER-BI.
data anaylst project (supermerket sales)
---Analyzed supermarket sales data and created an interactive dashboard to get insights of the market sales using POWER BI
---Initially used Microsoft EXCEL to clean and transform data such as checking any null value, negative value, transforming date column form MM/DD/YYYY to DD/MM/YYYY and other works (As data was small about 1000 rows so preferred EXCEL instead of SQL) 
---Then done ETL process means export, transform , load in POWER BI software.
---As there was only single tables so DATA MODELING was not required.
---Used different types of charts ( pie chart , donut chart , stacked bar chart, line and stacked column charts) and used table and slicer for shoeing interaction with each branch and enable the STAKEHOLDER to understand the complex parameter in easier and interactive way and get insights through data driven decision making process
